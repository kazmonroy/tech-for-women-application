              I want to become a Web Developer to create a better everyday life
              for the many people and make a positive impact in the world.

        <h1>Why This Course</h1>

        <p>
          Diversity and inclusion are among the biggest challenges in the tech
          industry today. It is evident that there are many successful and
          respected male software engineers as the industry has long been
          male-dominated. I envision a world where women and non-binaries could
          be proportionally represented as recognized software engineers,
          technical leaders and role models. However, it is crucial to act and
          be the change we want to see in the world. Therefore, the IT – Tech
          for Women course is the right place to start to be part of this
          change.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am excited to study this course because I want to pursue a career in
          Web Development and narrow the gender gap in the tech industry. I
          enjoy learning new things and challenge myself. In fact, I started
          self-learning web development this year and discovered that Web
          Development pushes all the buttons for my passions. It brings together
          creativity and problem solving to build web applications with a
          purpose to make a positive impact in people's lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I look forward to network with aspiring female developers
          like me and be inspired by female guest speakers. I want to upskill
          and expand my knowledge through this course as it covers modern web
          technologies and tools such as JavaScript, React and Figma, which are
          essential to build web pages and web apps. I enjoy learning by doing
          and look forward to learn together with other like-minded female
          classmates who also seek to achieve diversity in Tech.

        <h1>Future Developer</h1>
        <p>
          I think I would be a great future developer because I believe being a
          web developer is more than just programming and building beautiful
          websites, it is an opportunity to make a positive impact and help
          people through the power of technology. As an aspiring future
          developer, I want to build websites and web applications with a
          purpose, something that people can use every day and make their lives
          better. Web development in particular has enabled society to utilize
          the magic of the internet and solve many of everyday problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, I want to influence change and make the world a more
          inclusive and safer place. As a web developer, it is always important
          to put user's experience first regardless of any physical condition.
          Therefore, it is imperative to consider web accessibility best
          practices when developing a new website. Moreover, in today's global
          “data economy”, it is crucial to make secure websites and apps to
          protect user's personal information and be transparent about the data
          we gather to deliver a better personalized experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Building a website or a web app is much more than a series of
          well-designed elements and technologies bundled up together, it
          reflects who I am and what positive outcome I can bring to the world
          with all these technologies.

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hej! My name is Katherine Monroy. I come from Ecuador but I currently
          live in Malmö. I came to Sweden about 4 years ago to do my Master's
          degree in International Business Strategy at Linnaeus University in
          Kalmar. However, I am pursuing to change careers and become a Web
          Developer because it would give me the possibility to build web
          applications with a purpose to make a positive impact in people's
          lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I embrace change as an opportunity to learn and grow. Especially now
          that I wish to switch careers. Previously, I worked in Marketing for
          about 7 years. I worked with brands that stood for a purpose and made
          a positive change. However, I want to do more than marketing. I yearn
          to learn more, something different but alike. As with brands, the web
          is about creating meaningful and human connections in a creative way.
          Therefore, I became interest in Web Development as it gives me the
          possibility to be creative and craft my ideas by building websites and
          web apps to allow people connect and make technology accessible for
          everybody.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I am a driven person who enjoys learning and overcoming
          challenges. I am also a positive person who sees failures as lessons
          and motivations to improve. I enjoy traveling. I have always seen
          myself as a citizen of the world and I have been lucky enough to see
          it and meet new people from different backgrounds. This experience has
          allowed me to learn about different cultures and languages, embrace
          diversity but more importantly believe that combining ideas,
          especially within a diverse team, is the best way to innovate and
          create magical outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am thrilled to embark into this new Web Development career journey.
          I believe it is never too late to change one's story and I feel
          Sundsgården Folkhögskola is the best place to start.
